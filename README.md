# Complain
The aim was to created an Android app as part of the VVP hackathon that allows users to report non functioning streetlights. It provides a form for complaints, and an electrician will come to fix the issue without the need for a phone call.

Built using Java with Firebase Cloud Firestore integration for handling complaint report data and Firebase Authentication for login system. 

We had completed a whole application, during this hackathon.

But currently in application there comes a problem in verification due to firebase issue. So, it is not solved because we haven't open till as it part of hackathon.

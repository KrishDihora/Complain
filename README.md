# Complain
The aim was to created an app as part of the VVP hackathon that allows users to report non functioning streetlights. It provides a form for complaints, and an electrician will come to fix the issue without the need for a phone call.

Built using Java with Firebase Realtime Database integration for handling complaint report data and Firebase Authentication for login system. 

The first version of this application has also been released - feel free to check it out.
